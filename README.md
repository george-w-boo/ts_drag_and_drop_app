# ts_drop-down_app
Just a pet project to practice javascript with typescript. You have a form to fill in. Upon clicking the Add project button, the project appears in the Active projects list. Now you can drag and drop the project between two lists.

To run the project locally, you have to run the following commands:

`npm install`

`npm start` - then you'll get a URL to see the app on a browser (in development mode)

`npm run build` - run the app in build mode
